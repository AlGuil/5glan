# Welcome to 5G LAN Testbed Repositoy

Hi! This repo contains guidelines and scripts to setup a software-based 5G LAN testbed and run some basic performance evaluations. The testbed was used in our demo paper namely "Demonstration of LAN-type Communication for an Industrial 5G Network". This paper is presented at IEEE INFOCOM 2023, New York, USA.

## Guidelines

There are two guidelines, the first one guide you how to setup the testbed and the second one shows you how to run evaluations.

- [Setup](./Setup.md): Setup a 5G testbed with [UERANSIM](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM) and [Aether platform](https://docs.aetherproject.org)
- [Evaluation](./Evaluation.md): Run performance evaluations with the current testbed
